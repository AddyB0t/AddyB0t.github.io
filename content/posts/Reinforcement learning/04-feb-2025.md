## Value Iteration
Value iteration is a numerical method for solving Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems that relies on the dynamic programming operator $T_\mu$. Let's examine how this operator works and its key properties:

### The Dynamic Programming Operator $T_\mu$

For a given policy $\mu$, the dynamic programming operator $T_\mu$ transforms one value function into another. Mathematically, for any state $x$, we have:

<div class="math-block">
$$
\underbrace{(T_\mu J)(x)}_{\substack{\text{New value function} \\ \text{at state } x}} = \underbrace{E_{x_{k+1}}}_{\substack{\text{Expected value over} \\ \text{next states}}} \left[ \underbrace{g(x,\mu(x),x_{k+1})}_{\substack{\text{Stage cost under} \\ \text{policy } \mu}} + \underbrace{J(x_{k+1})}_{\substack{\text{Cost-to-go from} \\ \text{next state}}} \biggm\vert x_k=x \right]
$$
</div>


where:
- $g(x,\mu(x),x_{k+1})$ represents the immediate cost incurred when taking action $\mu(x)$ in state $x$ and transitioning to $x_{k+1}$
- $J(x_{k+1})$ captures the future cost-to-go starting from the next state $x_{k+1}$
- The expectation $E$ averages over all possible next states according to the system's transition probabilities

### Properties of $T_\mu$

1. **Monotonicity**: If $J_1 \leq J_2$, then $T_\mu J_1 \leq T_\mu J_2$
   - This means the operator preserves the ordering of value functions

2. **Contraction**: For any two value functions $J_1$ and $J_2$:
<div class="math-block">
$$
\underbrace{\|T_\mu J_1 - T_\mu J_2\|}_{\substack{\text{Distance between} \\ \text{transformed functions}}} \leq \underbrace{\alpha}_{\substack{\text{Contraction} \\ \text{factor}}} \underbrace{\|J_1 - J_2\|}_{\substack{\text{Distance between} \\ \text{original functions}}}
$$
</div>

   where $\alpha < 1$ is a contraction factor

### Value Iteration with $T_\mu$

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialize**: Start with any value function $J_0$

2. **Iterate**: For $k = 0,1,2,\ldots$
<div class="math-block">
$$
\underbrace{J_{k+1}}_{\substack{\text{Updated value} \\ \text{function}}} = \underbrace{T_\mu J_k}_{\substack{\text{Application of} \\ \text{DP operator}}}
$$
</div>


3. **Convergence**: The sequence $\{J_k\}$ converges to the optimal cost-to-go function $J_\mu^*$ for policy $\mu$:
<div class="math-block">
$$
\underbrace{\lim_{k \to \infty} T_\mu^k J}_{\substack{\text{Repeated application} \\ \text{of operator}}} = \underbrace{J_\mu^*}_{\substack{\text{Optimal} \\ \text{cost-to-go}}}
$$
</div>


This convergence is guaranteed by the contraction property of $T_\mu$, making value iteration a reliable method for computing optimal value functions in SSP problems. The rate of convergence is geometric, with error reducing by at least a factor of $\alpha$ in each iteration.
