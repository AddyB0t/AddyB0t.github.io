# Motivation
In previous lectures, we explored different sampling methods for generative models:

1. Langevin dynamics (LE):
   $$x_{t+1} = x_t + \alpha \nabla_x \log p(x_t) + \sqrt{2\alpha}\epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$$

2. DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models):
   $$x_{t+1} = \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_t + \sqrt{\beta_t}\epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$$

3. SMLD (Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics):
   $$x_{t+1} = x_t + \sqrt{\sigma_{t+1}^2 - \sigma_t^2}\epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$$

A natural question arises: What is the unifying mathematical framework that connects all these sampling methods?

The answer lies in Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). We will show that all these methods are actually discrete approximations of continuous-time SDEs. Understanding this connection provides several benefits:

1. A unified theoretical framework for analyzing different sampling methods
2. Better understanding of the relationship between different approaches
3. Potential for developing new sampling methods by working with SDEs directly

# Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)

Let's start by understanding how discrete sampling steps can be viewed as approximations of continuous processes.

## From Discrete to Continuous Time

Let's consider how to convert discrete sampling to continuous:
For a discrete process with:
- $\Delta t = \frac{1}{N}$ : The time step size, where N is the total number of steps
- $i = \frac{t}{N}$ : The current step index, where t is the continuous time variable
- $\beta_t$ : The noise schedule at time t
- $x_i$ : The state at step i
- $x_{i-1}$ : The state at previous step
- $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$ : Random noise sampled from standard normal distribution
- $I$ : Identity matrix
  
The discrete process is defined as:

$$x_i = (1-\frac{\beta}{2})x_{i-1}$$

Let's convert this to continuous time:
1. First, we can write $x_i$ in terms of continuous time $t$:
   $$x_i = x(\frac{i}{N}) = x(t)$$

2. Similarly for the next step:
   $$x_{i-1} = x(\frac{i-1}{N}) = x(t - \Delta t)$$

3. The discrete equation can be rewritten as:
   $$x(t + \Delta t) = (1-\frac{\beta\Delta t}{2})x(t)$$
   
   Note: We multiply $\beta$ by $\Delta t$ because $\beta$ represents a rate of change per unit time. 
   When we discretize time into small steps $\Delta t$, we need to scale $\beta$ accordingly to get 
   the correct amount of change for that time step. Without this scaling, the discrete steps would 
   not properly approximate the continuous process as $\Delta t \to 0$.

4. This is equivalent to:
   $$x(t + \Delta t) - x(t) = -\frac{\beta\Delta t}{2}x(t)$$

5. Dividing both sides by $\Delta t$:
   $$\frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\beta}{2}x(t)$$

6. Taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$:
   $$\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = -\frac{\beta}{2}x(t)$$

7. The left side is the definition of the derivative, so we get:
   $$\frac{dx}{dt} = -\frac{\beta}{2}x(t)$$

8. This ODE has the solution:
   $$x(t) = e^{-\frac{\beta}{2}t}$$

   This represents exponential decay of the state over time.

This is our continuous-time ordinary differential equation (ODE). Note how we included $\Delta t$ in steps 3 and 4 to properly scale the discrete change $\beta$ to an instantaneous rate of change in the continuous limit.
