Instructions:
- Whatever you write has to be mathematically precise along with mathematical notations that are consistent
- Explain the concepts in a way that build intuition in the student why it is being done and how it fits in the bigger picture
- The concepts should flow logically
- Be concise and to the point, try to explain the concepts in minimal words
- Usually write mathematical notations in a separate line
- Use $ for mathematical notations
- Use $$ for mathematical equations
- Use bullet points etc to make the content more readable
- use headings and subheadings etc to make the content more readable
- Do not keep repeating the same concepts in the same way
- Do explain the equations like $$
     \underbrace{\mu_k^*(x_k)}_{\substack{\text{Optimal policy} \\ \text{at stage } k \text{ for state } x_k}} = \arg\min_{a_k \in A(x_k)} \underbrace{E_{x_{k+1}} \left[ \underbrace{g_k(x_k,a_k,x_{k+1})}_{\substack{\text{Immediate stage cost} \\ \text{at stage } k}} + \underbrace{J_{k+1}(x_{k+1})}_{\substack{\text{Optimal cost-to-go} \\ \text{from stage } k+1}} \biggm\vert x_k, a_k \right]}_{\substack{\text{Expected total cost} \\ \text{from stage } k \text{ onwards}}}
